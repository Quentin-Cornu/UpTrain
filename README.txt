UpTrain is an iOS App I developped for my portfolio. 
Feel free to download it, simulate the app and send me your feedback. 
I will apreciate your help. 

To run the app on a simulator or on your personal iPhone : 

1 - Download the file
2 - Go into the folder where you can find a Podfile
3 - $ pod install 
4 - Open UpTrain.xcworkspace
5 - Run the app on a simulator or your physical device with Xcode
